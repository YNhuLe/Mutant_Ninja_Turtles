# 🐢 Mutant_Ninja_Turtles 🏁

This is a simple turtle race game where you can place a bet on the winning turtle. Each turtle has a different color, and you need to choose the color you think will win the race.

## Getting Started 🚀
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository, navigate to the directory,
and run the turtle_race.py file.


python turtle_race.py

## Rules 📜
    1. Choose a lucky color from the available options: 🟦 navy, 🟣 magenta, 🟤 dark goldenrod, ❤️ crimson, 💜 purple, 💛 yellow.
    
   
    2. The turtles will move forward randomly, and the first turtle to reach the right end of the screen wins.

   
    3. If your chosen color wins, you win the race.


## How to Play 🎮

     1. Upon running the program, a window will appear with color swatches for each turtle.

   
     2. Enter your bet by typing the color of the turtle you think will win.

   
     3. Enjoy the race and find out if your chosen turtle is the winner! 🏆

## Code Explanation 💻

The code uses the turtle module to create a simple graphical interface for the race. Each turtle is represented by a colored turtle shape, and they move forward randomly until one of them reaches the finish line.

The GameBrain class in the game_brain module is responsible for managing the race and determining the winner based on user input.

## Requirements 🛠️
* Python 3.x
* Turtle module (comes with Python standard library)
